Today we learned about dictionaries, sets, and interacting with files. I also found out we can use py.test --verbose to 
provide a verbose description of all the tests or py.test--cov to display the percentage of your code that your tests are 
covering. We also learned how to create our own packages using setup from setuptools, although I think I need to watch that section one more time because most of it went over my head.
We also learned that pip install -e runs it in developer mode.
