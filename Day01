Day1 Learning Journal

Today I learned how to create a virtual environment. I learned 
that inside the environment we're only concerned with the .bin
and the .lib files. This will ensure the computer checks 
those files for the module version before it checks elsewhere
on the computer.

We also learned some basic info about Python but it was largely stuff 
I'd learned through my miniature projects. However I get the 
impression the information I've learned will only last me until the 
end of the week, tops.
